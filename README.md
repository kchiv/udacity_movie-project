# Movie Project

This project will generate a web page that provides information about some of my favorite movies. It was created so that I could learn fundamental programming concepts such as 'classes' and 'instance variables' just to name a few.

## Installation

To run this code you must have [Python 2.7.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/) installed.

## Description

This project contains three files:

  - entertainment_center.py
  - fresh_tomatoes.py
  - media.py

### File: entertainment_center.py

This file contains all the instances of the 'Movie' class. This is the file that you will run to create the movie web page.

### File: fresh_tomatoes.py

This file contains all the HTML, CSS and Javascript used to create the movie web page.

### File: media.py

This file defines the 'Movie' class.

## Running the Script

1. Make sure all three files are within the same local directory.
2. Open entertainment_center.py using IDLE.
3. Once the file is open, click 'Run' drop down menu at the top and then select 'Run Module'
